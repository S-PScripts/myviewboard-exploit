# myviewboard-exploit
This webview was found by me, S-PScripts.

## Discovery:
-> My school had the Play Store but obviously you couldn't download any apps... except for one random one called "myViewBoard WhiteBoard", a digital mini whiteboard for students as an alternative to the real ones. <br>
-> This was probably something for teachers to use with us students, but most teachers didn't use whiteboards and the teachers that did use a whiteboard used actual ones or Google Canvas. <br>
-> I downloaded this app but I never took a close look at it - I never really checked for any webviews. <br>
-> I did take a look for webviews on an app called ASR. This was auto-installed and couldn't be uninstalled. I don't know why the school even had this app since I think it had even less point of existing than the whiteboard in our school. <br>
-> There were no webviews in ASR so I kept using proxies and moved on with my life. <br>
-> Except one day I saw Blobby-Boi in a 3kh0 discussion with a list of webviews. This made me thinking about the chance myViewBoard had one. <br>
-> So I checked... and well there was one. A great one too with a whole window GUI! <br>
-> Enough of me rambling now, here are the instructions. <br>

## Instructions:
1. Go to the download page for myViewBoard here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viewsonic.droid&hl=en&gl=US <br>
2. Install myViewBoard. If you can't, you cannot do this exploit. <br>
3. Open myViewBoard. <br>
4. Click "Let's sign up!" on the sign up window. It will open a MyViewBoard sign up page. <br>
5. Open a new tab in the app. It will open a different MyViewBoard page but you can ignore this. <br>
-> Extra note: On this MyViewBoard page, you can click the Google icon to log in to your personal Google account. <br>
6. Put any link in the search box (for example, https://discord.com - also you will need the https://) and click enter. <br>
If there isn't adjust the tab window with the squares in the bottom right. Or alternatively, click the icon between the "-" and the "X". <br>
-> You can also put a term and it will search the term with Google too! For example, put discord and it will search discord. <br>
7. Profit. <br>

## Notes:
-> If you closed the sign up window then you can click the icon in the bottom right to reopen it. <br>
-> Nothing shows in your history! <br>

## Issues:
-> It's a bit slow at loading pages and crashes sometimes. <br>
-> The CTRL key and some others do not work. <br>
